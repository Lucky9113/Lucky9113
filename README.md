# Hi, Iâ€™m Lakshay Menghani ðŸ‘‹

A proactive and hands-on AI/ML undergraduate with a demonstrated passion for cybersecurity. I build practical, security-focused projects to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real-world application in vulnerability management, incident response, and security automation.

## Featured Cybersecurity Projects

### 1. Automated Vulnerability Scanner & Management Tool
A Python-based tool that demonstrates a proactive approach to vulnerability management and security automation, directly addressing key requirements of a modern SOC.

- **Automated Scanning:** Developed a script using Python and Nmap to automatically scan network targets for open ports, services, and version information.
- **Vulnerability Enrichment:** Integrated the tool with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) via its API to cross-reference findings and pull detailed CVE information, including CVSS scores.
- **Risk Prioritization:** Engineered a reporting mechanism that generates a prioritized CSV report of vulnerabilities, sorted by severity, demonstrating a strong understanding of risk management.

### 2. SIEM-Based Incident Response Simulation
Deployed a containerized lab using Docker and the ELK Stack to simulate, detect, and respond to a real-world cyberattack.

- **SIEM Deployment:** Built a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) by deploying Elasticsearch and Kibana to ingest and analyze security logs from a "victim" machine.
- **Detection Engineering:** Authored a custom detection rule in Kibana to automatically identify SSH brute-force attacks based on log patterns.
- **Incident Response Playbook:** Developed a comprehensive incident response playbook detailing the exact steps for **containment, eradication, and recovery**, mirroring professional documentation used in corporate security teams.

## Additional Projects

- **Fintrack (Personal Finance Tracker):** Developed a secure application for managing sensitive financial data, implementing best practices for data handling and user authentication.
- **Receipt Reader & PDF Summarizer:** Engineered data processing pipelines to parse and analyze unstructured data from documentsâ€”a skill directly applicable to log analysis and threat detection in a SIEM environment.

## Technical Skills

- **Security Tools & Concepts:** SIEM (ELK Stack), SOAR Concepts, Vulnerability Management, Incident Response Playbooks, Threat Intelligence, Network Security (Firewalls, IDS/IPS), IAM Concepts (MFA, AD).
- **Scripting & Automation:** Python, Bash, Docker, GitHub Actions.
- **Core Technologies:** Linux, SQL, FastAPI, Streamlit, Transformers.
